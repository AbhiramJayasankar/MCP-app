## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🖥️ Developed FastAPI Backend for Ollama

* Created a Python-based backend using FastAPI to serve local Ollama models through an OpenAI-compatible API.
* Designed specifically for integration with OpenWebUI.

### 📦 Implemented `/v1/models` Endpoint

* Lists available models from the connected Ollama instance.
* Formats model list for compatibility with OpenWebUI.

### 💬 Implemented `/v1/chat/completions` Endpoint

* Core chat functionality endpoint.
* Supports both regular and streaming responses.
* Translates message formats between OpenAI API standards and Langchain/Ollama expectations.

### 🌐 Integrated CORS Support

* Added CORS middleware to FastAPI.
* Resolved preflight `OPTIONS` request issues, enabling smooth communication from the OpenWebUI frontend.

### 🐞 Iterative Backend Debugging

* **422 Unprocessable Entity Errors:** Fixed by refining Pydantic models (e.g., accepting `model_id`).
* **Pydantic NameError:** Resolved naming issue with private fields.
* **Model Parsing Logic:** Corrected logic for parsing model list from `ollama` Python client.

### 🧪 Added and Tested with a Dummy Model

* Implemented a static-response test model.
* Confirmed that OpenWebUI correctly routes requests to the FastAPI backend.

### 🔁 Achieved Successful Backend ↔ OpenWebUI Communication

* Verified through server logs that:

  * OpenWebUI fetches the model list.
  * Chat requests are processed and responded to by the backend.
  * Responses return with `200 OK`.

## 🚧 Current Focus

### ✅ Verifying Full Chat Functionality with Real Ollama Models

* Testing seamless interaction with actual models (e.g., Gemma, Llama3) through the FastAPI backend.

### 📌 Ensuring Consistent Model Routing

* Confirming OpenWebUI consistently routes all relevant requests through the FastAPI backend rather than its default Ollama connection.
